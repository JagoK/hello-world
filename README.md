# hello-world

Greetings, folks!

My names is James, and I'm interested in learning web and game development.

I also love to doodle and draw, which I find myself doing almost every day.
I have a little bit of prior coding experience from school, but I'm looking
to add a lot more to that through my own studies and projects!
